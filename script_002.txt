As she stood in front of the mirror, her eyes scanning the dimly lit room, she heard the ominous voice on the other end of the line, K-O-K-W calling. Come in, a phrase that sent shivers down her spine, but she knew it was just another delivery of garlic - a desperate attempt to ward off the thing that lurked beyond the glass.

She grabbed her keys and headed out into the night, the fluorescent lights of the convenience store flickering like candles in the darkness as she made her way to the back room, searching for more mirrors and more garlic, her mind numbly repeating the mantra fuel for survival as the weight of her existence settled heavy on her shoulders.

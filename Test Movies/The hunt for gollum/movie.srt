00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The story begins in the dark forests of Middle Earth. Strider is hunting for the creature Gollum.

2
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:20,000
He tracks footsteps in the mud. The trail is fresh but dangerous.

3
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:20,000
The local villagers speak of a shadow growing in the East. Fear is spreading.

4
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Strider enters the local tavern to gather information. The mood is tense.

5
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:20,000
He finds an Orc blade left behind. The enemy is closer than he thought.

6
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:20,000
The hunt continues into the night. Rain begins to fall heavily.

7
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Strider lights a small fire, but quickly puts it out to avoid detection.

8
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:20,000
He hears a noise in the bushes. He draws his sword.

9
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It was just a wild animal. He sheathes his blade and keeps moving.

10
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Morning breaks. The sun reveals the path leading towards the mountains.

11
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:20,000
He spots Gollum in the distance, crawling near the riverbank.

12
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Gollum senses he is being watched and flees into a cave.

13
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Strider follows him into the darkness. The air is cold and damp.

14
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Ambush! Orcs attack from the shadows. A battle begins.

15
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Strider fights off three Orcs with skill and precision.

16
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:20,000
More enemies arrive. He is outnumbered but stands his ground.

17
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:20,000
He uses the environment to his advantage, trapping the Orcs.

18
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:20,000
The fight ends. Strider is wounded but victorious.

19
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:20,000
He tends to his wounds and resumes the pursuit of Gollum.

20
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Gollum has escaped through a narrow tunnel. The trail has gone cold.

21
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Strider climbs to a high vantage point to scan the horizon.

22
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:20,000
He spots smoke rising from a distant camp. Is it friend or foe?

23
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:20,000
He approaches the camp cautiously. It is a group of Elves.

24
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:20,000
The Elves offer him aid and information about the creature.

25
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:20,000
They warn him of the Nazgul searching for the Ring.

26
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Strider leaves the Elves and heads towards the Dead Marshes.

27
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:20,000
The marshes are treacherous. One wrong step means death.

28
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:20,000
He sees faces in the water. The spirits of the dead are restless.

29
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Finally, he catches Gollum in a snare trap.

30
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Gollum struggles and curses "Baggins" and the "Precious".

31
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Strider binds him and begins the long journey back.

32
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:20,000
The return journey is harder. The enemy knows he has the prisoner.

33
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Orc riders appear on the horizon. A chase sequence begins.

34
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:20,000
They run through the forest, dodging arrows and blades.

35
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Strider makes a stand at a narrow bridge to protect the prisoner.

36
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:20,000
He holds the bridge against the Orc captain. A duel ensues.

37
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:20,000
With a final strike, the Orc captain falls. The path is clear.

38
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:20,000
They reach the borders of the Elven lands. Safety is near.

39
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:20,000
He delivers Gollum to the dungeon of the Wood Elves.

40
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:20,000
The mission is complete. But the war for the Ring is just beginning.
